# What
Want more activity in your discussion? Make it easy for users to comment! Instead of having them click the "reply" button or reach the end of the discussion, make the composer always visible. 

# How
This extension doesn't require any configuration. Simply enable it to have the composer module always visible. It's automatically adjusted to the discussion the user is currently viewing.
